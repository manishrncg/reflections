How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Really felt the ease of finding the problem with the code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Looking at your past files can get you a brief of what you did and where mistakes were made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Other than coding you need another thought of when to commit for a good listing of all changes and might be bad in a hectic schedule. At this hectic point automatically saving leaves mixed saves without any logic but rduces a task.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git was made for the developers in which case their are more chances of different files linked or related to each other and it would be good so each change creating differences in all files get saved. While Google docs was never made for using multiple files connected to each other and never needed it.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log gives a whole bunch of commits made to the file with a specific comment refering the change and Git diff allows us to compare those files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It really makes a difference in the confidence level as now I have strength to try something without any hesitation or keeping track for the old versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Learning JavaScript and hope it is usefull for that.
